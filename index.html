            <p> 
                Visualizing beyond what we can see and currently experiencing is defined deeply by the book man's search for meaning in which he states:<br>
                "Life asks you the meaning of life by questioning you; you don’t ask life. It’s not what you expect from life, but what life expects from you."<br> these block of words have deep meaning to my soul for It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly…Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

                <h2>Buju Bantons Analogy</h2> 
            </div> 
                      
            <p> 
                Buju Banton in a recent interview with the Breakfast Club shared that “ when you rent a house you cannot change the structure to fit your<br> needs. Meaning you are forced to work with the structure and if you don’t want, you leave .<br>‘Til I’m Laid To Rest’
This is a song of frustration, a call for a return to black people’s ancestral, spiritual and physical roots. It expresses the need for escape from the hardships of the quotidian, with hopes set on a better life in a faraway ‘promised land, in this case ‘the East’ or Africa: Work 7 to 7 but I’m still penniless/All the food upon my table Massa God bless/Holler for the needy and shelterless/Ethiopia awaits all prince and princess. There are hints of Garveyism in this song as well – it reiterates the concept of the African diaspora (among whom Jamaicans are numbered) coming together to return to the Motherland: Organize and centralize come as one/Our seeds shall be so many more than sand. It is the song of the people, especially those who support Negritude, Pan-Africanism, Rastafarianism and Garveyism. In essence, until Buju is ‘laid to rest‘ in the Motherland, and if the current oppression continues, he will ‘always be depressed‘.

                <h2>Structures we have inherited from colonial and western culture</h2>

            <p> 
               After many years of political independence in most African nations, claims that Africa should depend on imported economic development models for it develop leaves much be desired. It appears for Kenya the imported economic models have brought misery and poverty for most citizens. The models have given advantage to the west at the expediency of developing countries in terms of impetus for economic growth in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In addition, globalization process is a major trend both now and in the future as it spans opportunities and risks in many countries. The debate has gained space in Kenya as we can see consumption patterns, life styles and culture evolving over time in the livelihoods of the people. Not surprisingly, therefore, the poorest countries are faced with great difficulties in upholding their cultural identities as their heritage has so far been undermined by the western cultural identity.

Although it could be disputed that western values are superior to non-western values because no culture is superior to another, it is a known fact that their creativity, disciplined political leadership and strong democratic institutions contributed significantly to their development. Therefore, no culture is superior to another culture development wise. What matters most is the ability of the people of any nation to transform their culture to trigger off development in order to meet their immediate and future needs. But that is not to say that the developing countries did not contribute to such development. It is evident that the rich natural resources of Kenya not only contributed, but also sustained, and have continued to sustain development in the industrialized countries.

            <p> 
               The central theme of Man’s Search for Meaning is the possibility of finding meaning in life regardless of circumstances.<br> According to Frankl’s theory of logotherapy, finding and fulfilling meaning is the primary motivation in every individual’s life, and it is the task of the logotherapist to awaken his or her patients to the hidden meaning in their lives. <br>It is the “will to meaning” that drives humanity, Frankl believes, rather than Sigmund Freud’s “will to pleasure” or Alfred Adler’s “will to power.”

            <p> 
                The culture of a people is what marks them out distinctively from other human societies in the family of humanity. The full study of culture in all its vastness and dimensions belongs to the discipline known as anthropology, which studies human beings and takes time to examine their characteristics and their relationship to their environments. Culture, as it is usually understood, entails a totality of traits and characters that are peculiar to a people to the extent that it marks them out from other peoples or societies. These peculiar traits go on to include the people's language, dressing, music, work, arts, religion, dancing and so on.Before we can have an appraisal of African culture and values, it is necessary for us to have an understanding of the concept of culture and its meaning.

            <p> 
                By raising awareness, mental health can now be seen as an illness.  These illnesses can be managed by treatment.  We should not isolate mental illness from the physical heath conditions, such as diabetes, blood pressure, or cancer.Awareness is a form of education.  The more you know, the more power you have.  Knowledge is power.  This power can cause a positive effect in our community.  Awareness is key for understanding what mental health is and how families can receive the help they need. Public knowledge is important in accessing community resources.  Lack of awareness of mental health is not just “their” problem, it is our problem as a community.
